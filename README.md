Credit Risk Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a loan applicant is a high-risk or low-risk borrower using financial and demographic data. The project includes data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and evaluating multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The final tuned XGBoost model prioritizes identifying high-risk applicants, achieving a balance between accuracy and recall. This system can help banks reduce loan defaults by detecting risky borrowers early.
